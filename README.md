# Latex Template #
A LaTeX template to use for smaller reports. It has a title page,
table of contents, various starter subsections, appendices and a 
bibliography.

Made for use with The University Of St. Andrews. You will need to  
change the title page image if you are elsewhere.

# Usage #
Open in your favourite Latex editor - mine is Texpad.  
Compile with XeLaTeX and use Bibtex for the bibliography.

If compiling from terminal then compile with:
xelatex my_template  
bibtex my_template
xelatex my_template
xelatex my_template

You may or may not need the last two xelatex compiles.

I used Texpad on a Mac, which handles compilation for you - it's good.
